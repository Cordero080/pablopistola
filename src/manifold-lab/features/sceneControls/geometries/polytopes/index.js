/**
 * Polytopes Geometries Barrel Export
 *
 * This file provides centralized exports for all polytope geometry modules.
 * Polytopes are multi-dimensional geometric shapes including:
 * - 3D polytopes: icosahedron, octahedron, tetrahedron
 * - 4D polytopes: tesseracts, 120-cell, 24-cell, 16-cell, 600-cell
